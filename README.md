# SPM Assignments
**Assignments for the course of _Parallel and Distribute Systems: Paradigms and Models_ @ University of Pisa**

Assignment 1: evaluate overhead needed to start/join a thread and to start an async (launch::async policy) and get the result of the computed future. Measures should be taken as averages of a large number of events. Possibly, measure times on your machine AND on the remote virtual machine.
